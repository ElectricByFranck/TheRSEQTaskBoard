This project is built using a modern, scalable, and developer-friendly technology stack:

| **React** : Frontend library, Component-based UI, it's great for our collaborative apps 
| **TypeScript** : JavaScript superset with static typing, it prevents bugs, improves editor support 
| **Firebase** : Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), it handles authentication, real-time database
| **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework, it enables rapid, consistent, and responsive styling 

React powers the UI and manages application state with reusable components.
TypeScript adds strong typing to JavaScript, helping catch bugs early and improving maintainability.
Firebase is used for:
  - Authentication (sign-up, login, secure sessions)
  - Firestore database (task data, user roles, messaging)
Tailwind CSS ensures your app looks clean and is responsive across devices without writing custom CSS files.
Cloudinary is used to store data such as files(artefacts linked to a task).

This stack ensures the application is fully functional, responsive, real-time, and 100% free to run within the limits of Firebaseâ€™s Spark plan and Cloudinary's free plan.
